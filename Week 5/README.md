## Classwork Problems:
1. Create a new Jupyter Notebook that:
  - Contains a map
  - Zooms to a particular city of interest
  - Changes the basemap from the default Terrain basemap
  - Please use Markdown to apply meaningful discriptions of your steps.
2. Create a second notebook that geocodes the attached CSV of addresses. Please include a popup with each!
3. Save this as a webmap following from this example (https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/working-with-web-maps-and-web-scenes/#Saving-or-Updating-a-web-map). Be sure to go to ArcGIS online and check that the Webmap is there!
