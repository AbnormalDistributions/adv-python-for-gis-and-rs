## Preparation:
- Watch this video on [Jupyter RISE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gx2TnIdt0hw)
- Watch this video on [Jupyter Dashboards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Jktm-Imt-I)
- Check out the Following Dashboards on [Notebooks.esri.com](http://notebooks.esri.com). They will be in the samples/02_power_users folder.
  - jupyter_dashboard_for_raster_analytics.ipynb
  - [building_a_change_detection_app_using_jupyter_dashboard.ipynb](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/sample-notebooks/building-a-change-detection-app-using-jupyter-dashboard/)

## Lecture
### Jupyter RISE
- Install RISE
```conda install -c conda-forge rise```
- Turn my Ocean Depth explorer into a RISE presentation

### Jupyter Dashboard
- Install Jupyter Dashboards
```conda install -c conda-forge jupyter_dashboards```
- Demonstrate the Geoenrichment Dashboard

## In Class Problems:
1. Turn what you submitted for **Project 2** into a presentation using Jupyter RISE
2. Go through the [Change Detection Dashboard Example](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/sample-notebooks/building-a-change-detection-app-using-jupyter-dashboard/) and recreat it yourself. 
3. Create a Jupyter Dashboard that shows the Demographic data on a map, alows users to click on a specific county, and shows a pie chart breakdown of the demographic data for that county.

## Homework:
1. Work on **Project 3** (your **Final Project**).
