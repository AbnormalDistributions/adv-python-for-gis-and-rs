## Prepatation:
Please read [Raster processing using Python Tools](https://geohackweek.github.io/raster/).
- [Introduction](https://geohackweek.github.io/raster/01-introduction/)
- [Geospatial Concepts: Raster Data](https://geohackweek.github.io/raster/02-rasterconcepts/)
- [Encodings, Formats and Libraries](https://geohackweek.github.io/raster/03-encodingsandformats/)
- [Working with Raster Datasets](https://geohackweek.github.io/raster/04-workingwithrasters/)

We will not follow this, verbatin, but we will go though the techniques that are shown here.

Also, please take a look at this tutorial for [using imagery layers that are hosted online](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/using-imagery-layers/). If we have time, we wil cover this too.
