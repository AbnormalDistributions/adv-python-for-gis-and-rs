### Let's Learn Leaflet!!!
Leaflet -> Is an open-source JavaScript library for interactive web maps. It's lightweight, simple, and flexible, and is probably the most popular open-source mapping library at the moment. Leaflet is developed by Vladimir Agafonkin (currently of MapBox) and other contributors.

**What Leaflet does:** "Slippy" maps with tiled base layers, panning and zooming, and feature layers that you supply. It handles various basic tasks like converting data to map layers and mouse interactions, and it's easy to extend with plugins. It will also work well across most types of devices. See Anatomy of a Web Map for an introduction to the most common kinds of web maps, which is what Leaflet is good for.

**What Leaflet does not do:** Provide any data for you! Leaflet is a framework for showing and interacting with map data, but it's up to you to provide that data, including a basemap. Leaflet is also not GIS, although it can be combined with tools like CartoDB for GIS-like capabilities. If you need total freedom of form, interaction, transitions, and map projections, consider working with something like D3.

### Let's Get Started!
#### The Anatomy of a Web Mapping Application using Leaflet.
- HTML
  - HyperText Markup Language
  - Provides the layout for a webpage
  - Is at the core of every web page
- CSS
  - Whereas HTML was the basic structure of your website, CSS is what gives your entire website its style. 
  - slick colors, interesting fonts, and background images -> thanks to CSS
- Javascript
  - Programming language that lets web developers design interactive sites
  - Most of the dynamic behavior you'll see on a web page is thanks to JavaScrip
  - And it's become a lot more than this!!!
