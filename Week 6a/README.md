## Optional Classwork Exercises
These exercises are optional this week. You don't need to explicitly do them but please use them to guide you on the classwork problems below.
1. [How to share your content](https://developers.arcgis.com/labs/python/share-your-content/)
1. [Batch Creation of Groups](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/sample-notebooks/batch-creation-of-groups/)

## Classwork Problems
1. Using Python, create 3 groups in ArcGIS Online: 
 - *YOUR_FIRST_NAME*_Webmaps
 - *YOUR_FIRST_NAME*_Feature_Services
 - *YOUR_FIRST_NAME*_All_Content
2. Using Python, share any webmaps you have in your ArcGIS Online account with *YOUR_FIRST_NAME*_Webmaps. Share any Feature Services you have with *YOUR_FIRST_NAME*_Feature_Services,and share all content you have with *YOUR_FIRST_NAME*_All_Content. Note that if you have not webmaps or feature services, publish a feature service and create a webmap beforehand.
3. (**Bonus**) - Export all ArcGIS Online users to a CSV file.
