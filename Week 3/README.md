## Prepatation: [Publishing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AzOodYTHs4) and [Automating your WebGIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LfJrk2_VRg)

## Lecture:
### Into to Publishing Data
1. Using ArcGIS Pro or Arcmap, publish some data to ArcGIs Online.
2. Log into AGOL from Pro or ArcMap
3. Change Symbology of Webmap
4. Publish features with Feature Access.
5. Go to ArcGIS Online and open the new feature service.
6. Add the feature Service to a Map.
7. Restyle if Necesary.

### Analysis using ArcGIS Online
1. Next show how we can aggregate those point features by a hexagon or square grid
2. Also show how we can interpolate points (run EBK) through ArcGIS Online

### Automating it with Python
Demonstrate how we can automate the workflow above with Python

## Classwork Exercises:
1. [Publishing from a pandas dataframe](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/sample-notebooks/html-table-to-pandas-data-frame-to-portal-item/)
2. [Publishing from a Shapefile](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/sample-notebooks/publishing-sd-shapefiles-and-csv/#Publish-a-feature-service-from-a-shapefile-and-update-the-item-information)
3. [Publishing from a CSV](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/sample-notebooks/publishing-sd-shapefiles-and-csv/#Publish-a-CSV-file-and-move-it-into-a-folder)


## Classwork Problems:
1. The [UNHCR Data API](http://popdata.unhcr.org/wiki/index52ce.html?title=API_Documentation) provides robust statistics on immigration accross the work. Using the data API, create 5 new items in ArcIGS Online (or 1 webmap with 5 layers) of the location and number of assylum seekers from each location seeking assylum in England (GBR), France (FRA), Australia (AUS), Germany (DEU), and the USA (USA). Please see the UNHCR Sample Notebook to help get you started. The maps should look something like the following:
