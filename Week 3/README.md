## Lecture:
### API Core Concepts

#### Collections and Autocasting
Example
- [Graphic collection](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/sample-code/layers-featurelayer-collection/index.html)
- Reads GeoJSON, converts to esri/Graphic collection, renders them on map.
- Autocasts the GeoJSON graphics into an array that becomes a feature service.
- Relating back to Python, C++, etc., in those languages, if we hat a number that was a string, but was really an integer, we would have to cast that string to an integer as follows
```
number = **int**("1")
```

#### Pomises
The evolution of event listeners.
Back in my day, we had events listeners, functions like:
- onClick
- onSelect

At ArcGIS Javascript API 4, *promises* tell you when an action is complete or when something is ready
